			I-Box Track, Topper Track and Traditional Wooden Track Compared

			<p>
			There are many differences, while still having similarities between traditional wooden, I-Box, and Topper 
			coaster models. First of all, I-Box, having its track fully steel is classified as a hybrid. It is steel 
			track with wooden structure. Topper track on the other hand, is a steel box (grout filler) placed on 
			top of a stack of wood. This makes it classified as a wooden coaster even though it has a feel like a 
			steel hybrid. It feels like a steel hybrid for multiple reasons. First, the addition of a steel cross-tie 
			on the Topper model, makes this coaster more stable than a traditional wooden ledger. Secondly, having the 
			thin steel slabs (that the roller coasterâ€™s wheels run on) prefabricated makes this ride very smooth, 
			something traditional wooden coasters do not generally have. Finally, Topper track having a steel box 
			(grout filler) on top of the stack of wood, also makes it much smoother than having only a stack of wood 
			like what the traditional wooden coasters have. This is why a Topper track RMC feels like a hybrid but is 
			technically a wooden coaster.

			Most of the time a steel coaster will be smoother than a wooden coaster. The I-Box track is almost always 
			smoother than the other two. This is mainly because it is all steel. The Topper track is mainly steel but 
			still has a wood stack. Since it is partially wood, it will naturally be not as smooth but with the rest of 
			the track being steel and having lots of technology, the Topper model is still very smooth, just not as much 
			as the I-Box. Finally, traditional wooden coasters are mostly rough. Unless they are prefabricated, they do not 
			really have good technology from most of them being old and since generally, a full wood coaster is going to 
			be rougher than a full steel coaster.
