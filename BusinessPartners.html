		Rocky Mountain Construction works with many different amusement companies. The main one being Six Flags.  
		RMC has made 9 coasters for Six Flags and in 2020, they will be adding one more. This will make a total 
		of 10 RMCs at Six Flags parks. There is another very big company that works with RMC like Six Flags called 
		Cedar Fair. Even though they are a huge company like Six Flags, they only have 3 RMCs. Rocky Mountain 
		Construction has also made coasters for smaller parks. This includes: Kentucky Kingdom, Silver Dollar City, 
		Dollywood, etc. Recently, RMC has expanded and created coasters for parks in Europe and Japan. This includes 
		Hakugei at Nagashima Spa Land (Japan), Untamed at Walibi Holland (Netherlands), Wildfire at Kolmarden (Sweden),
