			What is Rocky Mountain Construction?
		</h2>
		<p style="color:Brown;">
		Rocky Mountain construction, well known as RMC for short, is a roller coaster manufacturer
		based in Hayden, Idaho, United States. They take old wooden roller coasters that are rough
		and unliked and turn them into smooth, intense hybrid roller coasters. Hybrid means that the 
		coaster is part wood, part steel. They also have a steel model called the Raptor. This is a 
		monorail style roller coaster.
