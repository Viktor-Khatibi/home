		RMC was founded in 2001 by Fred Grubb and Suanne Dedmon. Later in 2009, Alan Schilke of Ride
		Centerline started providing designs and engineering work for RMC. In 2011, RMC debuted their 
		first roller coaster: New Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas. They took Texas Giant, which was 
		a old wooden roller coaster and made it into an amazing hybrid. This was their I-Box Track model
		which was invented in 2008. This was a huge move for the roller coaster industry. This was just 
		the first of many roller coaster from this company. New Texas Giant was a great success and RMC 
		continued making roller coasters. They went on to make Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City in 2013, 
		their first roller coaster of their other now famous model: Topper Track. RMC continues to make
		world class, well loved coasters to this day, making them better, scarier and more thrilling as
		they go on. They might still be a fairly new company, but every one of their roller coasters that
		they have made have been awesome.
