			<h1>
			Models
			</h1>
			<p>
			As of this day, Rocky Mountain Construction has 3 models of roller coasters. The first 2 being Topper 
			Track (example: Lightning Rod at Dollywood) and I-Box Track (example: Steel Vengeance at Cedar Point). 
			These 2 models are very similar. With them, RMC takes older, rougher, unliked wooden roller coasters 
			and redoes them giving them steel track. The roller coasters then become hybrids. RMC then adds steeper 
			drops, inversions, banked turns and more! The third model is called the Raptor. This is a full steel, 
			monorail coaster. These are new compared to their other models. As of this day, there are 2 coasters of 
			this model. (Railblazer at California's Great America and Wonder Woman Golden Lasso at Six Flags Fiesta 
			Texas). In 2020, there will be the third raptor going to Six Flags Great Adventure called Jersey Devil. 
			This coaster will have an original layout unlike the other 2 raptors which are clones of each other.

				<h2>
				I-Box 
				</h2>
				<img src= " Images/Hakugei.jpg" width="960" height="540" alt="Hakugei">
				<p>
				This model, like said previously, takes an old wooden roller coaster (sometimes a new wooden structure) 
				and turns it into a much smoother, more intense hybrid. This model sits on all steel ledgers. This 
				eliminates the need for the traditional wood stacks. This model is for 2 main purposes. The first and 
				main purpose is to rehabilitate an old wooden coaster into a new, modern state. The second purpose, not 
				used as often, is to make a ground up I-Box roller coaster which means RMC comes in and makes all of the 
				roller coaster, this includes the wooden structure. The old wooden coaster is unable to provide high 
				thrills with its older technology and so the I-Box model upgrades the roller coaster into a much more 
				intense ride, adding many more tight compact elements including: high banks, steeper drops, inversions, 
				etc. All this that an old traditional wooden roller coaster cannot have. This all happens while still 
				keeping the traditional wooden feel. (Roller coaster element: each individual part that makes up the 
				roller coaster layout).
				</p>
				<h3>
				Benefits
				</h3>
				<ul>
				    <li>It reduces maintenance costs. It has a very long track life. These results in long term savings.</li>
					<li>The track also provides an extremely smooth ride. This reduces the liability for the company buying 
					the coaster since there will not be any roughness that might hurt or upset a rider.</li>
					<li>This model of track is not very hard on the structure. This puts much less stress and fatigue on the 
					structure than what a traditional wooden coaster will have.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>
				Topper 
				</h2>
				<img src= " Images/outlawrun.jpg" width="555" height="555" alt="Outlaw Run">
				<p>
				This model is also like the I-Box track in a way. It is used to redo old wooden roller coasters while still 
				could be a ground up new coaster. This model consists of taking the top two layers of the traditional wood 
				track and replacing it with a steel box. A new six layer laminated wood stack is attached to the bottom of 
				the steel box during the manufacturing process. 
				</p>
				<h3>
				Benefits
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Keeps the general feel of a traditional wooden roller coaster</li>  
					<li>Low maintenance costs</li>
					<li>Very smooth, keeping the coaster enjoyable</li>
					<li>Lack of roughness keeps the liability low for the amusement park (the smoother the ride, the less of 
					a chance for guest injury/uncomfort)</li>
					<li>Exiting elements can be added to the Topper track model such as: extreme banks, very steep drops, 
					inversions, high speeds, etc.</li>
					<li>Has a traditional feel while still being modern and intense</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>
				Raptor 
				</h2>
				<img src= " Images/WonderWomanGoldenLasso.jpg" width="920" height="595" alt="Wonder Woman: Golden Lasso">
				<p>
				The Raptor coaster model is a single rail track technology. It uses less steel compared to the traditional 
				dual track steel coasters from having only one rail. It requires less installation time because it has 
				smaller track and does not require as much of a support structure than other coasters. It also requires 
				less space because of its compact layouts and shorter ride cycles than other coasters. This makes it a 
				more affordable option for amusement parks. Since it is much more affordable, even small parks can install 
				this model. With its one seat across and eight seats long trains, this coaster does not have the greatest 
				capacity, making it great for smaller parks with smaller crowds. The single person rows also make for a more 
				intimidating ride since you do not have anyone beside you and since you have open air on both sides of you. 
				Since the rail is narrow and the trains are short and not very wide, it means that this coaster will have 
				much more quick and jerky inversions, quicker bank turns and will offer a different experience compared to 
				traditional steel coasters.
				</p>
				<h3>
				Benefits
				</h3>       
				<ul>
					<li>Not as much support structure needed, making this model very budget friendly. This makes a Raptor 
					good for any size amusement park.</li>
					<li>Short and narrow trains plus narrow track make this coaster able to have much tighter, quicker 
					elements such as faster turns, quick and sudden drops, etc.</li>
				</ul>
